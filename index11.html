             <h2>About Gotta Have Beans</h2>
             <p>
                
                I created "Gotta Have Beans" because Kobe Bryant was more than a basketball player in my eyes. Kobe bryant was my role model in life.
                Growing up when I played basketball, I tried to mimic ever basketball move I seen him do. I got so good at his moves my friends and
                family started calling me "bobe". I wasn't nowhere near good as him, but that didn't stop me from trying. Growing up I also owned
                almost every kobe shoe he released. I even had my own custom pair. Kobe had a huge impact on my life and how I attack eveything 
                that challenges me. So in honor of the great kobe bryant, I give you "Gotta Have Beans".
